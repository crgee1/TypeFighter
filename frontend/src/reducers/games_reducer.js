let defaultPassage = `In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods. A new salt is randomly generated for each password. The salt and the password are concatenated and processed with a cryptographic hash function, and the resulting output is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later authentication without keeping and therefore risking the plaintext password in the event that the authentication data store is compromised.`;
